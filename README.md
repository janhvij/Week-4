## Overview

The fourth week explored advanced features of Java programming. We started with generic programming and moved into the powerful Java Collections Framework. We also covered file input/output using streams, exception handling for robust applications, and testing with JUnit along with regular expressions. The week concluded with a look at major enhancements introduced in Java 8, such as lambda expressions and functional interfaces.
